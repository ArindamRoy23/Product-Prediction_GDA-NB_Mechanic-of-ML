##### Hi, 
###### Welcome to this repository! The objective of this repository is to best understand Naive Bayes . The data used in this repo has been taken from Kaggle (link below).

### About project Mechanic of Machine Learning:
I am a mechanical engineer by education. Now, I want to deep dive in the world of Machine Learning, hence the name, mechanic of ML :D. I have taken up this project to understand the in-depth mathematics involved in regularly used ML algorithms. Under this project, I will be sharing useful material and links as I explore this domain. The objective is to learn and spread the same. Stay tuned to my GitHub for updates!

### Business Case: 
An online retailer wants to classify data based on description provided by seller. Generate a model to facilitate this ask. 
### Notebook objectives:
* To understand and implement naive bayes 


### Assumptions:

* Only five category data is considered from the total set
